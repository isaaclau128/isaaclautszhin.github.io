Hello! I'm Isaac, a student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in the Technology and Management - Dual Degree Program. Currently majoring in Computer Engineering with an Exdended Major in Digital Media and Creative Arts and Bachelor of Business Administration, I am able to integrate my interdisciplinary studies into problem solving for the modern world. I am exceptionally interested in artificial intelligence, computer vision and multimedia.

In terms of working, I have strong experience in project management, taking leadership in various projects and liasing between teams. Ultimately, I enjoy working in a team-based environment, where each and every team member feels valued and comfortable to voice their own opinions. 

Outside of academics, I am passionate in music and performing arts. I also love to travel, experience different cultures and ways of living, and interact with people from all four corners of the world.
